# Security

Sample Scala scripts demonstrating cybersecurity concepts from beginner to advanced levels.
Each example uses an ``advanced insult`` generator to add levity while learning.

## Scripts

- `scripts/Insult.scala` – Shared utility generating humorous insults.
- `scripts/BeginnerPortScan.scala` – Basic port scanner showing socket usage.
- `scripts/IntermediateBruteForce.scala` – Simulated password brute-force tool using in-memory wordlist.
- `scripts/AdvancedSniffer.scala` – Packet sniffer that invokes `tcpdump` and decorates output.

These scripts are for educational purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization
before running security tools against any system.
